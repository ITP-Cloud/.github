### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is this organization all about?

This organization is all about building a miniature cloud platform for students in high school, college and university.
ITP actually stands for Industrial Training Platform. It's an initiative by students to build a miniature cloud platform so that we 
can have a glimpse into how things (possibly) work on the cloud. In addition, by means of this platform, students can improve their
coding, collaboration and devops skills as they prepare to work in the real world.

Consequently, this GitHub organization acts as a central repository for all the components of the ITP Cloud Platform. The main repositories include:

1. itp-core: The main website and developer console.
2. itp-engine: The main cloud platform manager.
3. itp-sdk: A set of tools and APIs to allows developers to programmatically manage their resources. 
4. itp-cli: A Node.js CLI tool for developers to use when managing projects and resources.

### üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?


Before contributing, please review and abide by our [Code of Conduct](link-to-code-of-conduct.md). We expect all contributors to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of their background, identity, or beliefs.

1. Fork the Repository: If you haven't already, fork the desired repository on GitHub to your own account.

2. Set Up the Development Environment: Follow the instructions in the project's README to set up your local development environment.

3. Create a New Branch: Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes. Choose a descriptive and concise name for your branch.

4. Make Changes: Make your code changes, improvements, or bug fixes. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards and guidelines.

5. Test: If applicable, write tests to validate your changes and make sure they do not introduce new issues.

6. Commit and Push: Commit your changes with clear and meaningful commit messages. Push your changes to your forked repository.

7. Create a Pull Request: Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main repository's master branch. Provide a clear description of the changes you made and reference any related issues if applicable.

8. Review Process: Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers and contributors. Be open to feedback and be willing to make necessary changes to your code.

9. Merge: After your pull request passes the review process and any required changes have been made, a maintainer will merge it into the main repository.

### Guidelines for Contributions

1. Respect the License: Make sure to understand and comply with the project's license before contributing. Only submit contributions that you have the right to provide under the project's license.

2. Keep It Civil: Treat everyone with respect and courtesy, both in discussions and when submitting issues or pull requests. Avoid offensive, harassing, or inappropriate behavior.

3. Pull Request Etiquette: Keep pull requests focused on a single issue or feature. If you want to address multiple issues, submit separate pull requests for each.

4. Code Standards: Follow the coding standards and conventions established by the project. If there are no established guidelines, try to match the existing code style.

5. Testing: If your contribution involves code changes, ensure that your changes are covered by appropriate tests. This helps maintain code quality and reduces the risk of regressions.

6. Documentation: Update relevant documentation, such as README files or inline code comments, to reflect your changes and help other contributors understand the project better.
